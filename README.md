## ðŸŒŸ Project Description

SoundIQ simplifies the task of predicting music popularity using a machine learning pipeline. It features:

- A **frontend** built with React and styled using CSS for user interaction.
- A **backend** powered by FastAPI, which processes data and handles predictions.
- A machine learning model integrated into the backend for real-time predictions.
- Deployment on **Vercel** (frontend) and **Render** (backend), ensuring scalability and availability.

Key functionalities:

1. **Music Popularity Prediction**: Upload track data to get predictions.
2. **Model Retraining**: Update the prediction model with new datasets.
3. **Data Insights**: Interactive visualizations and result interpretation.
